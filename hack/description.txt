Project Overview
This project is a Flask-based web application for simulating and monitoring human vital signs in real-time. It generates synthetic vital data (heart rate, SpO₂, temperature), evaluates the health condition using basic logic, logs the readings, and presents this via a web API.

Description
The system consists of four main components:

Flask App (app.py):

Hosts a web server.

Exposes an API endpoint (/api/vitals) that returns live simulated vitals and analysis in JSON format.

Renders a basic web interface (index.html, not provided but referenced).

Sensor Simulation (sensor_simulation.py):

Simulates health data: heart rate, oxygen saturation (SpO₂), and body temperature.

Introduces a controlled probability of generating abnormal values for testing alert conditions.

Health Analysis (health_ai.py):

Analyzes vital signs for anomalies.

Flags any abnormalities (e.g., high heart rate, low SpO₂).

Returns a status (OK or Warning) and any relevant alerts.

Logger (logger.py):

Logs all vitals and their corresponding health analysis results to a CSV file (health_log.csv).

Each record includes timestamp, vitals, status, and alerts.

Use Cases
Medical Training Simulations: Demonstrating how patient monitoring systems respond to various health conditions.

Prototype Development: Serving as a baseline for building more sophisticated IoT or AI-driven health monitoring solutions.

Testing Data Pipelines: Generating realistic, timestamped health data for analytics, visualization, or machine learning testing.

Remote Health Monitoring Demos: Mimicking the behavior of wearable health devices to test backend infrastructure.

Design Highlights
Modular Architecture: Each functionality (simulation, analysis, logging, UI/API) is cleanly separated, promoting easy expansion.

Randomized Input Generation: Smart simulation design allows normal and edge-case vitals for robust testing.

Simple Rule-Based AI: The health analysis relies on threshold logic but is extendable to ML models.

Persistent Logging: Captures data for audits, visualization, or longitudinal studies.
